Notes
------------------------------------------------------

After you deploy a contract to Ethereum, itâ€™s immutable, which means that it can never be modified or updated again.
This is one reason security is such a huge concern in Solidity. If there's a flaw in your contract code, there's no way for you to patch it later.

So if we hardCode a value it will be impossible to changeit in future , thats why we need some functions that can change the key part (dynamic things) 
of contract that could be change when needed in future.
