# MyLearnings

This repo belongs to me and purpose of making it is that my 10 year old kid in future could understand it also anybody who wants to learn frontend can reach out to this repo  . 
I started making this repo on 11th of June 2022 . This is a small part of my journey of becoming a blockchain devloper from scratch. Scratch means really SCRATCH .
. This README file is just a daily journal for me .

Journey is long  and you must accept the fact that YOU CAN NOT KNOW EVERYTHING .
